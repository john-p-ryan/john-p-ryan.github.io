This repository contains the code for my personal website, linked [here](https://john-p-ryan.github.io).

The website is built with GitHub pages using Jekyll with the Minimal theme. Contents of most pages are made in markdown. 
I used [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) to set up the website.
