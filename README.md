# john-p-ryan.github.io

This repository contains the code for my personal website, linked [here](https://john-p-ryan.github.io).

The website is built with Rmarkdown. Most files are custom formatted, following the example of Alex von Hafften (GitHub: vonhafften), and built to look like the Jekyll minimal theme.

In order to fix the titles of pages in the browser, some low level changes of the html files were necessary since no title is provided in Rmarkdown. This is to fix the error of titles appearing as "file.knit" in the browser.
