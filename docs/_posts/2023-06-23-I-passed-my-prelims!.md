> "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way" - Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities

This quote encapsulates my experience during my first year in the econ PhD at UW-Madison. It was a tough journey, but it has all paid off. That is because I passed my preliminary exams! There has been much anxiety leading up to this moment, but I have learned so much in the past year.
