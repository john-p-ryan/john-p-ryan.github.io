This quote encapsulates my experience during my first year in the econ PhD at UW-Madison. 
It was a tough journey, but it has all paid off. 
That is because I passed my preliminary exams! 
There has been a lot of anxiety leading up to this moment, but I have learned so much in the past year.

Since I passed, I have about 2 months of time to rest, and work on a few projects, one of which has been building this website. 
I plan on learning Julia, getting better at Git / Github, sketching out a research idea or two, polish my senior thesis, and maybe contribute to some other projects.
